### User Feedback:

Provide feedback to the user, indicating whether the data was added successfully or if there was an error.

## Read (R) - Fetch Data

### Fetch Data from Firestore:

In your "Read" component, create a reference to the Firestore collection. Use `getDocs` to retrieve a snapshot of the documents in the collection.

### Update State:

### Refresh Data:

After updating, refresh the displayed data by fetching it again from Firestore.

## Delete (D) - Delete Data

### Select Data for Delete:

When the user clicks the "Delete" button, set the `selectedDocId` state with the ID of the document to be deleted.

### Delete Data in Firestore:

Create a reference to the specific document in Firestore using `doc`. Use `deleteDoc` to delete the document, providing the document reference.
